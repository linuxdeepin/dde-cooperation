# DDE Cooperation Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram]()

### Core Layers:
1. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - BaseKit: Core utilities and platform abstractions
   - NetUtil: Network utilities and protocols
   - Logging: System logging infrastructure

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - TransferHelper: File transfer core logic
   - Device Management: Device discovery and pairing

3. **Application Layer**
   - GUI Applications
   - CLI Tools

## Module Structure

### Infrastructure Modules
- **basekit**: Core utilities and platform abstractions
- **netutil**: Network communication utilities
- **logging**: System logging components

### Core Libraries
- **TransferHelper**: Handles file transfer operations
- **DeviceManager**: Manages connected devices

### Applications
- **dde-cooperation**: Main GUI application
- **dde-cooperation-cli**: Command line interface

## Key Components

### Transfer System
- Bidirectional file transfer
- Resume capability
- Progress tracking

### Network Communication
- Uses ASIO for cross-platform networking
- Custom protocol for device communication

## Dependencies
- Qt ${QT_VERSION_MAJOR} (Core, Network, GUI)
- ASIO network library
- System logging libraries
